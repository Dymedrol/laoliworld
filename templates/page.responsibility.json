The majority of our jewelry is made using 100% recycled 14kt and 18kt gold, conflict-free gemstones, cultured diamonds produced in India, and responsibly produced natural pearls. Our partnering ateliers are small, family-run businesses that are Responsible Jewelry Council-certified, chosen for their focus on quality craftsmanship, time-honed techniques, sustainability and ethics. All our our beaded necklaces handcrafted in our Parisian studio and are made from natural beads and shells that our designer Olivia has personally sourced."
