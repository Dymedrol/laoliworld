We have chosen to only use the highest quality materials and to avoid using newly mined raw materials. Our jewelry is made using 100% recycled 14kt and 18kt gold, conflict-free gemstones, cultured diamonds produced in India, and responsibly produced natural pearls. Many of our suppliers are small, family-run businesses and they are all Responsible Jewelry Council-certified, to ensure accountability throughout the supply chain. Our artisans are the best there are for every element we need, focusing on quality craftsmanship, time-honed techniques, sustainability and ethics. Our gem-setters are in Bangkok, our pearl-stringers are in Paris, all chosen by their level of workmanship and commitment to the same high standards that we uphold."
